# Permissions

When talking about permissions there are three groups of permissions that may be talked about, user bot permissions, user discord permissions and bot discord permissions.

## User Bot permissions

These are permissions granted to users (or to users via roles) by server managers.
These permissions grant access to bot actions, such as sending messages, editing messages, etc.  
These permissions can be set at a global level, or a per channel level.

### The Permissions

An entity (user or role) can only be assigned a single permission, individula permissions grant access to permissions before.
For example a user with the <InlineCode>EDIT_MESSAGES</InlineCode> permisison effectivity has the <InlineCode>VIEW_MESSAGES</InlineCode>, <InlineCode>SEND_MESSAGES</InlineCode> and <InlineCode>EDIT_MESSAGES</InlineCode> permissions.

Since users may have multiple roles, the role with the higher permission is counted.
So a user may have a role with <InlineCode>NONE</InlineCode> that is above another role they have with <InlineCode>DELETE_MESSAGES</InlineCode>, the permissions for that user would be <InlineCode>DELETE_MESSAGES</InlineCode>.

- <InlineCode>NONE</InlineCode> - No permissions, used to deny permissions previously
  granted
- <InlineCode>VIEW_MESSAGES</InlineCode> - Currently has no effect, will be used
  to grant access to web based features
- <InlineCode>SEND_MESSAGES</InlineCode> - Grants access to sending messages wherever
  the bot is able
- <InlineCode>EDIT_MESSAGES</InlineCode> - Grants access to editing messages previously
  sent via the bot
- <InlineCode>DELETE_MESSAGES</InlineCode> - Grants access to deleting messages previously
  sent via the bot
- <InlineCode>MANAGE_PERMISSIONS</InlineCode> - Allows a user to manage permissions
  (on a server and / or channel level) for other users / roles below their top role.
- <InlineCode>MANAGE_CONFIG</InlineCode> - Allows a user to manage server level config
  (such as the logging channel, etc). **Cannot** be set on a channel.

<Hint type="info">
  If a user has the <InlineCode>ADMINISTRATOR</InlineCode> discord permission,
  they can carry out any bot action.
</Hint>

### Hierarchy

Each "level" of permissions completly overrides the permissions from previous levels.

1. Roles - Server
2. User - Server
3. Roles - Channel
4. User - Channel

This means that permissions can be granted / denied for certain channels / users.

<Hint type="warn">
  This could lead to unintended denials! For example, a user has 'role 1' which
  grants them <InlineCode>DELETE_MESSAGES</InlineCode> on the guild, however
  they also have 'role 2' which grants them
  <InlineCode>VIEW_MESSAGES</InlineCode> on a channel. The user will **not** be able
  to send, edit or delete messages in that channel, even though no permisisons for
  'role 1' are set on that channel.
</Hint>

### Commands

On each command there is a <InlineCode>channel</InlineCode> option which will, if selected, act on a channel level instead of a server level.

#### Setting permissions

Command: <InlineCode>/config permissions set</InlineCode>

This command will set the permission for the target passed in the <InlineCode>target</InlineCode> argument.
User's cannot set permissions above their top role, and cannot set a permission where they do not have that permission, or the target has a permission above their permissions.
This does not apply to administrators or the server owner.

#### Removing permissions

Command: <InlineCode>/config permissions remove</InlineCode>

This command will remove the permission from the target passed in the <InlineCode>target</InlineCode> argument (this is the same as setting to <InlineCode>NONE</InlineCode>).
User's cannot remove permission from a target where the target's permission is above their permissions.
This does not apply to administrators or the server owner.

#### Listing permissions

Command: <InlineCode>/config permissions list</InlineCode>

This command lists the permissions for the level provided (decided by the <InlineCode>channel`option). Any user with the`MANAGE_PERMISSIONS</InlineCode> permission on that level can use this command.

## User Discord Permissions

These are discord permissions a user must have, to be able to use a command. Currently the only restriction is on the <InlineCode>VIEW_CHANNELS</InlineCode> discord permission.
That permission is required for making message management actions, in the channel the message is / will be in.

<Hint type="info">
  If a user has the <InlineCode>ADMINISTRATOR</InlineCode> discord permission,
  they can carry out any bot action.
</Hint>

## Bot Discord Permissions

These are discord permissions the bot requires to function.

To carry out message actions:

{/* prettier-ignore*/}
{/* This is becuase prettier will shortern the links (over multiple lines) in the list, which breaks the list */}


- <InlineCode>VIEW_CHANNELS</InlineCode> / <InlineCode>READ_MESSAGES</InlineCode> (it might be either of these names)
- <InlineCode>SEND_MESSAGES</InlineCode>
- <InlineCode>EMBED_LINKS</InlineCode>
- <InlineCode>ATTACH_FILES</InlineCode>
- <InlineCode>SEND_MESSAGES_IN_THREADS</InlineCode> (only for threads)
- <InlineCode>USE_EXTERNAL_EMOJIS</InlineCode> (only if required in the message)

To enable logging:

- <InlineCode>MANAGE_WEBHOOKS</InlineCode> (on the logging channel)
