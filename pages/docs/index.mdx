# Introduction

This is an open source discord bot written in [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).  
Source code is available at [AnotherCat/message-manager](https://github.com/AnotherCat/message-manager)

## Functions

- Message management (editing and sending)
- Customizable prefix and server settings

### Info Message Management

We've all had the issue of wanting to edit an important server information message, but can't because the person that send the message is offline.  
This bot aims to be an easy to use solution to this.  
With a few simple, interactive commands you can send messages from the bot, and more importantly edit those messages with another command.
