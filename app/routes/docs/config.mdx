# Configuration

This is a guide on all bot related config (excluding permissions)

## Logging

Logging provides a way to keep track of actions taken on the bot. This is useful because some actions don't cause any high visiblity effects.

Logging works with the use of webhooks, to help with global ratelimit issues.

Use the `/config logging-channel` commands to manage the logging channel.

<Hint type="warn">
  If the webhook used for logging is deleted, and the bot does not have the
  `MANAGE_WEBHOOKS` discord permission on that channel, logs will fail
  **silently**.
</Hint>
