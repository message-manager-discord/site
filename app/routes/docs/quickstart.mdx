# Quickstart

This is a quick guide to what we do, and how to get setup quickly.

## What we do

This service allows discord messages to be managed (edited, deleted, etc) by multiple discord users.
Common usecases are rule messages, info messages, and more.
This is done by sending messages via the bot account, which is done through discord interactions.

## Setup guide

### Setting up

#### Inviting the bot

Invite the bot using [this link](/invite) to do so.  
This will invite the bot with all required permissions - see <Anchor to="/docs/permissions#bot-discord-permissions">the permissions docs </Anchor>for a detailed breakdown on required permisisons.

#### Setting server config (optional)

We suggest setting up a logging channel, as most actions users can take are not visible (don't cause messages) for other users.
All actions that cause a change will be logged. We suggest this be a private / mod only channel.

To do this use the `/config logging-channel set` slash command.
For more information see the <Anchor to="/docs/config#logging">config documentation</Anchor>

#### Setting up permissions (optional)

This is optional, but without it only users with the `ADMINISTRATOR` discord permission will be able to take bot actions.

To do this use the `/config permissions quickstart` slash command.
This command will setup permissions with presets, for more information about having finer control see the <Anchor to="/docs/permissions#bot-discord-permissions">permissions documentation</Anchor>

#### Sending the first message

Now that you've done all that you're good to go! Get started by sending a message via the bot. (It's probally a good idea to use a private testing channel first).

To do this use the `/send` command, and select the channel you want to send the message to.

A modal (form popup) will appear, enter the message you would like to send into it.

For more info see the <Anchor to="/docs/message-management#sending">send documentation</Anchor>

#### Actions

Once a message has been sent you can perform actions on it. These actions are edit, delete and report.

To access actions right click (or long press) on a message that's been sent via the bot, and click on the "apps" button. Then scroll down to the bot and click "Actions".

An embed with further instructions will appear.

For more info see the <Anchor to="/docs/message-management#message-actions">actions documentation</Anchor>
