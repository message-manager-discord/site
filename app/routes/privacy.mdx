Cookies are only currently used by Cloudflare to detect bad actors and block them, and to provide their other services to us. These cookies do not allow cross site tracking and in most cases log data retrieved using these cookies is only stored for 24 hours by Cloudflare on their servers.

Channel ids are needed to enable the vc-channel stats function to find the right channel.
Webhook ids and tokens are needed for logging to function
Message content is needed to provide a history to users, and to show content on an upcoming web platform.

### To protect the Service

Data collected by Cloudflare is collected to protect the service from DDoS attacks among others attacks.
